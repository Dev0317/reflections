What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- A .git file is added to the directory
- No commits are created initially
- You need to do it if you want to track the version of files in a directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- It is an intermediate area
- It gives you more control over which files you want to commit to a repository
